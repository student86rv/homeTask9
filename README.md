Task 1
Suppose we have a class:

public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(),
and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(),
and third() is executed after second().

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls
second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.

Example 2:
Input: [1,3,2]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird"
is the correct output.

Note:
We do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the numbers in the input seems to imply the
ordering. The input format you see is mainly to ensure our tests' comprehensiveness.

Task 2 

Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n, however:
If the number is divisible by 3, output "fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, output "buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "fizzbuzz".
For example, for n = 15, we output: 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz.
Suppose you are given the following code:
class FizzBuzz {
  public FizzBuzz(int n) { ... }               // constructor
  public void fizz(printFizz) { ... }          // only output "fizz"
  public void buzz(printBuzz) { ... }          // only output "buzz"
  public void fizzbuzz(printFizzBuzz) { ... }  // only output "fizzbuzz"
  public void number(printNumber) { ... }      // only output the numbers
}
Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads. The same instance of FizzBuzz will be passed to four different threads:
Thread A will call fizz() to check for divisibility of 3 and outputs fizz.
Thread B will call buzz() to check for divisibility of 5 and outputs buzz.
Thread C will call fizzbuzz() to check for divisibility of 3 and 5 and outputs fizzbuzz.
Thread D will call number() which should only output the numbers.
